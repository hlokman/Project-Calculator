# Project-Calculator

The goal of this project was to create a simple calculator using what we've learned so far in the Odin Project's curriculum. 
The first step were quit simple (create the function for each basic math operators) and the project in itself seemed to be simple until you have to make the calculator works correctly!

The main difficulty was to store the different results and make the different operators works all together. It was not a problem to make the calculator works with each operator and operand working "independently" but when you want to make it works using the result and the operand of the previous operation it can easily lead to some unexpected issues.

Even with that in mind it's quit difficult to avoid unexpected behavior in one go. I stumbled upon a lot of them trying to complete this project: clicking several times on one operator, clicking several times on equal, dealing with the floating points and large number...

Storing the result and make sure the calculator doesn't behave illogically was the main issue for me in this project. It was also a good way for me to practice some CSS grid in order to make the calculator look legit.
